Implemented code on ESP32 to collect sensor data, processed it for temperature, humidity, pressure, PM
levels, and gas concentrations.
Utilized the ESP32â€™s built-in Wi-Fi capabilities to wirelessly transmit the collected data to a Thingspeak
server. Ensure data security and integrity during transmissions.
Developed a user-friendly interface on Thingspeak and IFTTT Applet, displaying data visually with charts
and graphs, while setting up alerts for critical weather or pollution conditions.
